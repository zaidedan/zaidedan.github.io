         In the 1700s, the first wave equation was studied by d'Alembert, Euler, and Lagrange among others,
$$\frac{ \partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} $$
  which has solution
 $$ u(x,t) = f(x-ct)+g(x+ct) $$
 <aside class="notes">
From Newton, there was no idea of a discontinuous solution in differential calculus. The math did not exist to allow for this type of solution, despite physical evidence from Daniel Bernoulli. Mathematicians d'Alembert, Euler, de la Grange, debated this until the mid 1800s. Euler used the idea of "improper" functions.

                <br>
                <br>
                <p>
The compressible flows they studied were similar to the Euler equations,
$$
\mathbf{u}_t + \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{u})_x = 0
$$
or expanded as
$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial{}t} \left[ \begin{array}{ccc} \rho{} \\ \rho u \\
E \end{array} \right] + \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left[
\begin{array}{ccc} \rho{}
u \\ \rho{}u^2 +p \\
\rho u H
\end{array} \right] = \mathbf{0},
$$
with $H = \frac{E+p}{\rho}$ and from the ideal gas law, $p = (\gamma-1)\left(E-\frac{1}{2}\rho u^2\right)$

                <aside class="notes">
                    It was Poisson in 1808 paper on theory of sound and Hugoniot's 1887 paper of shockwaves. This work had been discussed earlier. Early attempts to characterize shockwaves used the isothermal speed of sound, it wasn't until Rankine and other physicists improved their equation of states, and introduced conservation of energy into the system that the equations we see here took their form, and compressible shockwaves could properly be studied.

                <h2> A Discontinuous Solution </h2>
                <p>Integrating the equations and assuming a discontinuous solution yields the jump conditions, $$\Delta \mathbf{f} = S \Delta \mathbf{u}$$
That is, given the left preshock state $\mathbf{u}_L$ and the postshock density, $\rho_R$, the right pressure and velocity can be computed from
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{p_R}{p_L}&=&\frac{(\gamma+1)\rho_R-(\gamma-1)\rho_L}{(\gamma+1)\rho_L-(\gamma-1)\rho_R}\\
u_R-u_L&=&(p_L-p_R)\sqrt{\frac{2}{\rho_L\left((\gamma-1)p_L+(\gamma+1)p_R\right)}}
\end{eqnarray*}
Taking $\rho_R > \rho_L$ results in the physical Hugoniot curve, and $\rho_R < \rho_L$ results in the nonphysical Hugoniot curve.

                <p>
                    Divide the physical domain into cells $x_i$ with constant width $\Delta x$ and integrate the conserved quantities in space to get cell-averaged quantities as $$ \overline{\mathbf{u}}_i = \frac{1}{\Delta x} \displaystyle\int_{x_i-\Delta x/2}^{x_i+\Delta x/2} \mathbf{u}(x) \enspace \Delta x $$ Integrating the full equations in space, we get $$ \Delta x \overline{\mathbf{u}}_t + \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{u}(x_{i+\frac{1}{2}}))-\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{u}(x_{i-\frac{1}{2}})) = \mathbf{0} $$ Further intergrating in time from $t^n$ to $t^{n+1}$ leads to $$ \overline{\mathbf{u}}_t = \frac{\overline{\mathbf{u}}^{n+1}-\overline{\mathbf{u}}^n}{\Delta t} $$

                    The final scheme, explicit Forward Euler in space and time with the bar dropped for simplicity, is then $$ \mathbf{u}^{n+1}_i = \mathbf{u}^n_i - \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x}(\mathbf{f}^n_{i+\frac{1}{2}}(\mathbf{u}^n_i,\mathbf{u}^n_{i+1})-\mathbf{f}^n_{i-\frac{1}{2}}(\mathbf{u}^n_{i-1},\mathbf{u}^n_{i})) $$ with the flux coming from a Riemann solver (flux function), $$\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{u}(x_{i+\frac{1}{2}})) = \mathbf{f}^n_{i+\frac{1}{2}}(\mathbf{u}^n_i,\mathbf{u}^n_{i+1})$$ 
                    Godunov's method introduces a <i>viscosity</i> for numerical reasons.

<h2> Intermediate Shock States </h2><br><br>
<img src="images/shockstates.png" alt="Shock States" width="60%">
<p>For a single captured shock to be located anywhere on a 1D grid, at least one intermediate state is needed.<br><br>

Shock-capturing methods treat these intermediate states with value that they should not have, as if they satisfy the governing equations.<br><br>

However, inside a shock, local thermodynamic equilibrium isn't satisfied.

                    Intermediate states have no physical meaning but are book-keeping devices to ensure conservation, thus the values of the conserved quantities must be accepted.
                    <br>
                    <br> In this artificial situation, any interpretation of them is legitimate. Why should $\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{u}_M) = \mathbf{f}_M$?
                    <br>
                    <br> Instead of using the equilibrium equation of state to compute the flux, use neighboring information to interpolate its value.
                    <br>
                    <br> No pseudo-physical arguments will be invoked to evaluate $\mathbf{f}_M$. It is motivated solely by the desired numerical behavior.

                    To begin, suppose the flux is extrapolated from one side as $$\mathbf{f}_i^* =\mathbf{f}_{i-1}+\tilde{\mathbf{A}}_i(\mathbf{u}_i-\mathbf{u}_{i-1}) $$ and extrapolated from the other side as $$ \mathbf{f}_i^* =\mathbf{f}_{i+1}-\tilde{\mathbf{A}}_i(\mathbf{u}_{i+1}-\mathbf{u}_{i}). $$ where $\mathbf{A} = \frac{\partial \mathbf{f}}{\partial \mathbf{u}}$. These two equations are consistent if $$ \mathbf{f}_{i+1}-\mathbf{f}_{i-1} =\tilde{\mathbf{A}}_i(\mathbf{u}_{i+1}-\mathbf{u}_{i-1}). $$ The simplest flux Jacobian having this property is the cell-centered Roe matrix $\tilde{\mathbf{A}}(\mathbf{u}_{i-1},\mathbf{u}_{i+1})$. The flux can be interpolated from both sides as $$\mathbf{f}^*_i = \frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{f}_{i-1}+\mathbf{f}_{i+1})-\frac{1}{2}\tilde{\mathbf{A}}_{i-1,i+1}(\mathbf{u}_{i+1}-2\mathbf{u}_{i}+\mathbf{u}_{i-1}). $$

                <h2>Flux Function A</h2>
                <p>
                    With interpolated fluxes defined, a new flux function can be described similar to the original Roe framework. A rather conventional scheme might take the form $$ \mathbf{f}_{i+\frac{1}{2}}^A = \frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{f}^*_{i} + \mathbf{f}^*_{i+1}) - \frac{1}{2}|\tilde{\mathbf{A}}_{i+\frac{1}{2}}|(\mathbf{u}_{i+1}-\mathbf{u}_i)$$ but this does not preserve the desired shock structure. A scheme that does is $$ \mathbf{f}_{i+\frac{1}{2}}^A = \frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{f}^*_{i} + \mathbf{f}^*_{i+1}) - \frac{1}{2}\text{sign}(\tilde{\mathbf{A}}_{i+\frac{1}{2}})(\mathbf{f}^*_{i+1} - \mathbf{f}^*_{i}) $$ where $\text{sign}(\mathbf{A}) = \mathbf{R}\text{sign}(\Lambda)\mathbf{L}$.
                    <br>
                    <br> However this flux is not $C^0$ continuous.

                <br>
                <br><p> To overcome the discontinuous nature of new flux function A, another flux function, B, is developed.
                <br>
                <br> Inspired by Roe's Riemann solver, it can be written as $$ \mathbf{f}^B_{i+\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{f}^*_{i} + \mathbf{f}^*_{i+1}) - \frac{1}{2}|\overline{\mathbf{A}}_{i+\frac{1}{2}}|(\mathbf{u}_{i+1} - \mathbf{u}_{i}) $$ where $\overline{\mathbf{A}}_{i+\frac{1}{2}}$ is the Roe matrix across cells $i-1$ and $i+2$, $$ \overline{\mathbf{A}}_{i+\frac{1}{2}}(\mathbf{u}_{i+2}-\mathbf{u}_{i-1}) = \mathbf{f}_{i+2}-\mathbf{f}_{i-1} $$ The matrix $\overline{\mathbf{A}}_{i+\frac{1}{2}}$ looks at the big picture, around the shock.

                <p>
                    The internal states of a captured shock should not be taken literally; in particular it should not be assumed that they are in thermodynamic equilibrium.
                    <br>
                    <br> Using the equilibrium equation of state for these internal cells gives rise to ambiguity in the shock location, which can be linked to many of the problems that affect shock-capturing schemes.
                    <br>
                    <br> It is possible to smooth the fluxes in a way that has no effect on linear systems but which sets the internal fluxes of a stationary shock equal to the external fluxes.
                    <br><br>This can be made the basis of schemes that eliminate or greatly reduce this adverse behavior.

            <h2>Revisiting Artificial Viscosity</h2>
            <p>
         In our approach, we intentionally avoided the physics, ignoring the small scales inside the shockwave and did what was best for the numerics. <br><br>
            
            Historically though, in the Lagrangian frame, the original artificial viscosity was (von Neumann-Richtmyer)
            $$
            \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + \frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial (P+q)}{\partial x} = 0
            $$
            or by Richtmyer, 
            $$
            \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + \frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial P}{\partial x} = \frac{1}{\rho} \frac{\partial }{\partial x} \mu \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}
            $$
            for artificial viscous stress $q$ and artificial coefficient of viscosity $\mu$.
            <br><br>Our method reveals an artificial viscosity
       $\mathbf{A}_x|\mathbf{u}_x|$ rather than $\mathbf{u}_x|\mathbf{u}_x|$.
            </p>
            <aside class="notes">
 Originally called fictitious by von Neumann, later changed to artificial. These are negative in connotation, but they should really be called shock, or numerical viscosity, as they represent. This only affected the momentum equation.  There are many methods that do resolve the inner scales of the shockwave, Kun Xu uses sub-scale models, and viscosities based on resolving it. Either way, you're making stuff up. Here, we choose to do whats best for the numerics.
