                <p>In the simulation of shockwaves with a standard shock-capturing approach, anomalous behavior can often be seen such as

                <p>
                    If our simulations develop these problems, and our solvers treat these numerical errors as physical waves, we lose faith in the validity of our underlying simulation.
                    <br>
                    <br> This is particularly problematic in simulations where we are not certain of the expected physical behavior.

                <p>
                    Unlike other methods which alleviate the symptoms of the problem, my research focused on understanding the root cause of these errors, which was determined to be the nonlinearity of the shockwave jump conditions.
                    <br>
                    <br> While an improved method was developed in one dimension, its extension to two dimensions was problematic and is a current area of research.

                <h3> Research - Meshing </h3>
                <p>
<b>Problem:</b> take a pre-existing mesh and insert a series of prescribed internal
boundaries into its topology. <br><br>
<b>Goal:</b> obtain internal boundaries in a general,
pre-existing mesh with minimal mesh modification. <br><br>
<b>Motivation:</b> remeshing to match the surfaces of a newly
deposited layers of material in the simulation of the
semiconductor device manufacturing process.

 <h3> Research - Meshing </h3>
                <p>

Our approach is to insert and remove points with local
operations to recover the surface and post process to recover
quality. <br><br>
This allows for insertion of arbitrary geometries, with minimal
requirements on geometric smoothness and on topology or
quality of the existing mesh.<br>
<br> The novel aspect of our approach is the surface sampling to determine point spacing to minimize the effect on the existing mesh. <br><br> This also allows for fewer requirements in the existing mesh when compared with other methods.
